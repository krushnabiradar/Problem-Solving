Big o notation : Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of the time complexity or space complexity of an algorithm.

Time Complexity of Linear Search:
The linear search algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) in the worst-case scenario, where n is the number of elements being searched.


Time Complexity of Binary Search:
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n). This means that the number of operations required to find an element in a sorted array decreases.
